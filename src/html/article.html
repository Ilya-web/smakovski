            <h2>How do you Choose to Keep Score of Retention?</h2>
            <h6>The Huron team is one of Repeat's favorites to talk to when it comes to analytics. Many of the team come from a banking and finance background meaning they are no strangers to "the numbers." In this episode of Put it On Repeat Jonny Yu is walking us through all the ways they slice LTV to make it more actionable, and some of his tips on CPG retention.</h6>
            <p>By slicing LTV into smaller digestable pieces Huron is able to see whats happening on the retention front faster and as Jonny says "allows an apple to apples comparison." I also love that the Huron team is bringing in COGS (cost of goods sold) and the cost to acquire customers into the equation to focus on profit rather than top line revenue. Retention (especially in CPG) is about increasing both growth and profitability.</p>
